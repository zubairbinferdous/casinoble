              In our digitally driven, efficiency-loving Canada, a player’s
              inaugural perception of an online casino is significantly moulded
              by how effortlessly they can register and deposit. Seamless and
              secure registration, corroborated with instant confirmations via
              email or SMS, and a straightforward deposit procedure are
              quintessential. <br />
              We prioritize these initial phases at Chipsino, as they not only
              set the stage for a player’s entire journey but are also
              indicative of the reliability and user-friendliness of a casino’s
              digital interface.

              Secure and diverse banking options are vital for peace of mind for

              player preferences and respecting cultural financial nuances, is
              significant. <br />
              Casinos providing an extensive array of deposit and withdrawal
              avenues, including cryptocurrency and traditional bank transfers,
              are a nod towards international inclusivity and player

              In the dynamic digital landscape of online gambling, perpetual

              Chipsino gives paramount importance to the safety protocols
              employed by a casino. No matter how enticing a casino’s game
              offerings and promotions might be, if its safety provisions are
              flimsy, it cannot guarantee players’ peace and assurance, which
              are non-negotiable.

              With the rapid tempo of the online casino world, robust customer

              often reflected in its customer service quality. <br />
              Chipsino pays undivided attention to this facet, well aware that
              even the most glamorous games and promotions cannot salvage a
              casino’s reputation if its customer service falters. Stellar
              customer support not only fosters trust but also assures sustained
              patronage from keen gamers in Canada.

              <p className=" roboto-light">
                Though old well-established sites can be most reliable, they
                might not always work out for your betting needs and desires.{" "}
                <br /> <br />
                Sometimes, fresh bookmakers have a new take on the betting
                world. <br /> <br />
                That’s why Chipsino puts a lot of work into testing newly
                established sites as well, though in this case, our check-ups
                are even more rigorous. <br /> <br />
                After all, our goal is to bring the best sites to you, no matter
                if they’re new or old. <br /> <br />
                When it comes to new betting sites, odds or betting markets
                aren’t the most important factors. <br /> <br />
                Instead, proper licensing has the highest priority. <br />{" "}
                <br />
                Every single new betting site should adhere to Canadian laws and
                of course, be granted a gambling license. <br /> <br />
                Canadian players might prefer playing at offshore betting sites
                – if that’s the case, a license from Malta Gaming Authority
                and/or British Gambling Commission is a must. <br /> <br />
                If a new betting site doesn’t have a license, we won’t feature
                it at Chipsino – that’s a rule we’ve set in stone. <br />{" "}
                <br />
                After making sure there’s proper licensing, we can start

                <br />
                By now, eSports betting has become so advanced that most eSport
                betting sites offer a vast selection of betting options. <br />
                <br />
                Of course, you can make bets on “Match Winner” or “Outright
                Winner” (or even “Handicap”) but there’s a lot more you can do
                with real money bets. <br />
                <br />
                Certain eSports have specific betting options, such as Dragon
                Bets in League of Legends or betting on the first map in CS:GO.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                The market is growing fast and we can only expect more and more
                betting options. <br />
                <br />
                Just to be clear, eSports is not a short-fused trend. If
                anything, it’s only growing bigger, perhaps even becoming as
                popular as football betting. <br />
                <br />
                For example, eSports tournaments have even made it to the
                Guinness World Records with 100 million dollar prize pools.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                Putting your own real money bets into eSports is a real
                adrenaline rush: you can win money, plus you’re a part of
                something so trendy and new.

              <p className="roboto-light">
                League of Legends is one of the most popular video games of all
                time, having over 100 million players each month. <br />
                <br />
                In this MOBA game, two 5-player teams aim to destroy each
                other’s base. <br />
                <br />
                LoL is known for a huge character selection – you can choose out
                of more than 100 champion types. <br />
                <br />
                While the game map is always the same, each session is spiced up
                with some random monsters and creatures popping up. <br />
                <br />
                There are also different bonuses and prizes all around the map.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                Partially thanks to incredible graphics and versatile gameplay,
                League of Legends has become incredibly popular, both among
                everyday players and professionals.

                Counter-Strike is probably the most familiar game for many since
                most of us spent our teenage years playing CS with friends.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                Created two decades ago, CS has now evolved into a more modern
                and versatile version called Global Offensive. <br />
                <br />
                That’s also the version that’s now played as eSport. <br />
                <br />
                In its essence, CS is a first-person shooter with two sides:
                terrorists and anti-terrorists. <br />
                <br />
                The whole gameplay is incredibly simple: terrorists aim to
                destroy everything by planting bombs and the “good guys” aim to
                defuse the bombs and save the day. <br />
                <br />
                Counter-Strike is filled with an adrenaline rush, both for the
                players and the bettors. <br />
                <br />
                You never know which side might win!

                Dota 2 is a game that seems to break records left and right.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                This MOBA is played by over 40 million people every single day
                and has even broken Guinness World Records thanks to its vast
                popularity, both in the player count and amount of bets made.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                Considering the latter, in 2016 Dota 2 professional teams
                garnered about 21 million dollars in bets. <br />
                <br />
                To this day, no other eSport game has surpassed that yet. <br />
                <br />
                Dota, meaning Defense of the Ancients, is a little bit more
                complex video game. <br />
                <br />
                The main point is defending a structure that’s called the
                “Ancient” while destroying the other team’s Ancient. <br />
                <br />
                Both teams comprise five players while the game itself consists
                of over 120 playable characters overall.
