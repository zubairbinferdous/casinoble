              <p className="roboto-light mt-b-para">
              With the invention of the internet and subsequent advances in web payments and development, online casinos burst onto the gambling scene in the mid-1990s. <br /><br />

One of the first games adapted for the new digital form of the pastime was blackjack. <br /><br />

Since first transitioning over to the online world, blackjack has remained one of the most popular table games around. <br /><br />
 
It has also managed this with very few variations to the basic rule set played for many years now. <br /><br />

Some online gambling venues do offer unique versions of this classic game. <br /><br />

Most, however, are only slight variations on the now well-established theme. <br /><br />

In terms of gameplay, object, and rules, online blackjack is identical to live blackjack. <br /><br />

Apart from obvious physical differences between the two games, the only other distinguishing factor is how much faster it is to play online. <br /><br />

Players needn’t wait for everyone else to finish trying their luck against the dealer, they can get right to their own next hand immediately. <br /><br />

              <p className="roboto-light mt-b-para">
              Unlike in other card games, there aren’t really “hands” in blackjack. <br /> <br />

Whereas poker has different hand rankings – pair, trips, full house, quads, etc., blackjack only has the hand that the game itself takes its name from. <br /> <br />

The hand itself comprises any combination of a 10 (or face card) and an Ace. <br /> <br />

Blackjack beats all other hands except another blackjack. <br /> <br />

It even beats hands of 21 that comprise more than two cards. <br /> <br />

Players making blackjack usually also receive an additional payment from the dealer. <br /> <br />

Whereas a player victory would typically mean they receive back double what they initially wagered, when winning with blackjack (A, 10), they will receive payment at 3 to 2. <br /> <br />

Put simply, if they bet C$5 originally, they would receive their original C$5 back plus C$7.50 from the dealer. <br /> <br />

All other hands in blackjack go without names. <br /> <br />
 
The numerically higher of two competing hands always wins, providing it is 21 or less. <br /> <br />

              <p className="roboto-light">
              More recently, online casino operators have been keen to restore some of the charm of playing blackjack in the casino to the online experience. <br /><br />

Live casino games feature live streams of a real-world table along with a human dealer. <br /><br />

Players make bets from their computer or cell phone and follow the action via a webcam feed. <br /><br />

Naturally, being one of the first and most popular games at the online casino, live casino developers were quick to offer blackjack as soon as the format became available. <br /><br />

Even today, with much larger selections of casino games on offer at live casinos, you’re very unlikely to find an operator not hosting at least one or two games of live blackjack. <br /><br />

              <h2>Blackjack cards and their value</h2>
              <p className="roboto-light">
              Blackjack uses at least one standard deck of cards without Jokers. <br /><br />

Since suits are entirely irrelevant to the game, multiple decks are most commonly used. <br /><br />

This allows more hands to play out before the dealer needs to shuffle the deck and makes it much more difficult for would be card counters. <br /><br />

Each number card in the standard deck represents the value pictured on it. <br /><br />

Aces can be either high or low (1 or 11), depending on which creates the more favourable blackjack hand.<br /><br />

Finally, all face cards are worth ten.
