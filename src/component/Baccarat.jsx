              <p className="roboto-light">
                The origins of Baccarat are not at all clear. <br />
                <br />
                One thing is for certain though – it’s one of the oldest card
                games. <br />
                <br />
                Some believe it was invented by an Italian usurer as a means for
                a new source of income. <br />
                <br />
                The original name, “Baccara”, was an Italian word that, at the
                time, meant zero. <br />
                <br />
                Baccarat can boast the enviable record of having been able to
                keep players’ interest high over a really long period of time.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                It spread among the aristocrats in France in the 1400s. <br />
                <br />
                It arrived much later in America, with the first casino
                showcasing the game being Las Vegas’ Sands, in 1959.

              <h2>Basic Strategy of Baccarat</h2>
              <p className="roboto-light">
              In Baccarat and Punto Banco Live, as you know if you’re familiar with the rules, the only real choices are to bet on the bank, the player or the draw. <br /> <br />

For the rest, the game is decided by luck. <br /> <br />

Betting on the dealer, however, has slightly better odds than the other two options. <br /> <br />

Consider, however, that even if you apply your strategy, the casino applies a 5% commission. <br /> <br />

There are no particular strategies or tricks for winning Baccarat and Punto Banco live except to be inspired by James Bond and avoid the secondary bets. <br /> <br />

In fact, even though these may seem convenient, they increase the advantage of the house.
